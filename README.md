## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `Calendar` component in your application:

import React from "react";
import Calendar from "./components/Calendar";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return <Calendar />;
};

export default App;
```

## Unit Tests

To ensure the functionality of the calendar, we have included unit tests. Here are some basic tests for the `Calendar` component:

### `tests/Calendar.test.tsx`

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { render, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import Calendar from "../components/Calendar";

test("renders calendar header correctly", () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<Calendar />);
  expect(getByText(/July 2024/)).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test("toggles dark mode correctly", () => {
  const { getByText, getByRole } = render(<Calendar />);
  const button = getByRole("button");
  
  fireEvent.click(button);
  expect(getByText(/Light Mode/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  
  fireEvent.click(button);
  expect(getByText(/Dark Mode/)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
